Since Lorentz transformation simultaneously leads to doppler effect and variation of electromagnetic fields, a relationship between the frequency and the energy of an electromagnetic wave train can arise. It tends out that this relationship is linear, emulating the equation of photon energy $E=\hbar\omega$. This shows that wave-particle duality of light is compatible under space time transformation.
